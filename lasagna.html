                <h2>about this item: </h2>
                <p> The iconic lasagna dish from Italy is a combination of layers of pasta and tomato sauce, mixed with creamy cheese and various savory fillings, all prepared and baked to give you the perfect taste. We at Mama's Kitchen provide you with a lasagna that is comfy and indulging to eat and is made with attention to every bite having a delicious flavor and texture.


                    We commence with the pasta, cut in sheets, then spread over a nice tomato-based sauce. The bases of this sauce contains a good amount of ground meat, fresh chopped onions and garlic as well as traditional Italian herbs and spices. That produces a flavorful and strong base is the final one that provides the rest of the dish with a good start.
                    
                    
                    The lasagna's dish is made from a combination of layers of pasta and tomato sauce and at the middle, we add a generous amount of creamy béchamel sauce and a blend of cheese, usually mozzarella and ricotta. This results in a rich and brash consistency that blends well with the flavorful sauce. The lasagna is finessed by adding a final layer of cheese to the top which melts and turns golden brown during cooking, resulting in a bubbly and cheesy covering.
