                <h2>about this item: </h2>
                <p> The 'Chicken Cheesy Steak' dish is actually a fantastic and delightful meal made out of chicken and tasty cheesy sauce in which, while it tastes so good, it also gives you a sensation of feeling warm and comfy. The key ingredient in Mama's Kitchen Cheesy Steak Chicken is the use of a flavorful and mouthwatering blend to achieve a heavenly taste and consistency.


                    Our meat of choice is chicken breast, the sensitive part of the chicken, soaked so that it can take more flavor. The chicken follows to be grilled or pan-seared with the aim of making the skin achieve a golden-brown crust while keep the meat juicy and tender. This delicate cooking process will guarantee that the chicken is at its sweetest moment, where you can see a suitable equilibrium between an incredibly crispy outer shell and a moisture inside.
                    
                    
                    We slide a heavy layer of melted cheese onto the chicken right after then. This cheese could either be cheddar, mozzarella, or provolone, all of which bring together a creamy and flavorful melting topping that makes the chicken uncontrollably cheesier. To add up to the taste of a tasty topping, we often employ vegetables like onions, bell peppers, and mushrooms which contribute some sort of sweetness and earthiness to the meal.
                    
                    
                    Normally, the menu of Chicken Cheesy Steak consists of the guests who can choose between mashed potatoes, French fries, and a fresh salad as their side dish.
