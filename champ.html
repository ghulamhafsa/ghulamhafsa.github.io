                <h2>about this item: </h2>
                <p> The special [Framing Feels] Chaamp is the famous style of meat dish made of lamb chops which are marinated in herbal spices and then barbequed among the fragrance of fresh wood. Our commitment to ensuring that our customers enjoy homemade Special Chaamp is deep-rooted and is inspired by our culture as well as our dedication to produce meals that are rich and serviceable.


                    These lamb chops are made from top quality meat and wrapped in a mixture comprising of garlic, ginger, cumin, coriander, and garam masala as to add delicious flavors to their taste. Yogurt is commonly added to marinade for quite a few reasons. It not only tenderizes a meat and enriches the flavors of spices, but also acts as a marinade by itself due to its good properties. This fusing process gives chops a layered, intensified flavor, which is deep in lamb's muscle tissues and therefore are tender and rich in taste.
                    
                    
                    The Lamb chops could either be grilled or tandoori cooked which do not just look like paragon of nature, but are also incredibly juicy and succulent inside them. This technique is also an entity in itself to bring a smoky flavor more interesting and complex to the dish.
                    
                    
                    Uniquely, makings of the dish come together to form a special C.H.A.A.M.P which is best served with traditional bread; such as naan or roti, for an optimum absorbing experience for the savory juices. To mention it is lettuce leaves along with onions and fresh diced tomatoes as well. The chutney sprinkled on top acts as a refreshing counterbalance to the rich lamb.
