                <h2>about this item: </h2>
                <p> BBQ Kabab is a traditional Pakistani cuisine which combines the essence of typical grills. At Mama's Kitchen, we offer BBQ Kabab which is one of our customers' favorite item because of its smoky tastes, delicate texture and complex flavors.


                    We start with the high-quality ground meat usually the beef or lamb, and the next we mix it with the complex of spices. The marinade is made of ginger, garlic, cumin, coriander, and garam masala, and uses fresh herbs like cilantro and mint to give a fuller flavor. This pair forms the distinctive taste and tenderness of our BBQ Kabab.
                    
                    
                    The ground meat is flattened and molded into cylindrical kabobs, a form suitable for grilling on skewers. The kababs, once ready, are grilled over an open fire or in a tandoor until the marinade caramelizes on the exterior, leaving the inside moist and plump. Grilling and adding a delicious smokiness to the meat, which goes well with the sophisticated spices, is a process.
                    
                    
                    BBQ Kabab is usually presented with naan or roti and quite often is followed by either mint chutney, raita or fresh salad. It is a versatile dish that can be equally enjoyed at a family meal, a relaxed dinner or at a special occasion.
