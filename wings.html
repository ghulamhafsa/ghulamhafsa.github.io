                <h2>about this item: </h2>
                <p> Chilli Hot Wings are a hot and aromatic kind of food ideal for the people who enjoy having their chicken accompanied with a spicy kick. Mama's Kitchen offers Chilli Hot Wings, which are all set about spices, taste, and crispness to bring down every bite to an appetizing experience.


                    At the beginning, we get the superior quality chicken wings for unique marination of spices to make the wings tasty and awesome. Usually, the marinade features such as garlic, ginger, paprika, and cayenne, and since of that the wings are well seasoned inside and outside.
                    
                    
                    After we marinate them, we then proceed to deep fry them so that the exterior becomes crispy yet the interior remains meaty and tender. The frying procedure generates a scintillating crumble that only real hot wing can have. When deep-fried it is not complete until we toss it with our signature chilli hot sauce which is an intense combination of spicy and tangy that adds both heat and flavor.
                    
                    
                    The recipe for our hot chilli sauce is based on red chillies, vinegar, garlic, and other spices, and this creates a biting and zesty coating for our wings. Hotness and flavor of the sauce just fit in, so there is neither an excessive fiery kick nor a dump of the dish.
                    
                    
                    Chilli Hot Wings is best complimented with celery sticks and blue cheese or ranch dressing; these traditional side dishes help to bring down the heat. Either youâ€™re with friends at a party or catch them as snacks while you watch your favorite game, these wings are guaranteed to be a ultimate hit.
