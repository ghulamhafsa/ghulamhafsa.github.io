                <p> Anda Channay is another classic dish which brings together eggs and chickpeas in a sauce made of creamy yogurt and aromatic spices and is a prominent part of Pakistani Cuisine where it is highly praised for its strong tastes and solid texture. Mama's Kitchen prepares Anda Channay with authenticity being the foremost consideration, letting you have an experience of sitting on the bustling streets of Lahore, where it is liked by different people be it at breakfast, lunch, or dinner.


                    Our authentic Anda Channay begins with carefully selected chickpeas that are cooked until they are silky-smooth, preserve their texture, and maintain their integrity. In this dish, the sauce is what makes it soul, a complete tomato-based mixture comprises of ginger, garlic, onions and an intelligible spice mix of cumin, coriander, turmeric and garam masala. The finished product results from this synergy, with a robust and aromatic bottom that leaves the drinker feeling both comfortable and satisfied.
                    
                    
                    Then, boiled eggs jointly with the mixture are stirred so that they can be coated by the sauce. The eggs slowly cook in the chick pea mixture, which deliciously blends the different the tastes and textures. This is a soul nourishing dish because of the velvet-like richness of eggs and the slight nuttiness of chickpeas.
