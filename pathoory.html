                <h2>about this item: </h2>
                <p> Bhatoory Channay is one of Pakistani dishes that is very popular. It is the combination between fluffy deep-fried bread and a curry with chickpea. At Mama's Kitchen, we make the traditional combination with all the care in the world. Each ingredient in this dish is crafted perfectly to give the diner an unforgettable dining experience


                    The "bhatoory" in Bhatoory Channay means bhature which is a deep fried bread made from a fermented dough. Our bhature is softer and fluffier, with a beautiful golden-brown exterior and a soft chewy inside. When fried, it rises beautifully becoming the perfect holder for some aromatic and rich channay.
                    
                    
                    Channa, the second segment, offers a rich chickpea curry, which is loaded with spices and fragrances. At Mamaâ€™s Kitchen, our channay is prepared using a combination of ginger, garlic, onions, tomatoes, and a mixture of spices such as cumin, coriander, turmeric and garam masala. Chickpeas are cooked until soft, producing a curry that's thick, satisfying, and tasty as all get out.
                    
                    
                    The bhature, which is crispy yet soft, is the perfect companion to scoop up the channa and brings together flavours and textures. This dish is ideal for breakfast, brunch, lunch, or dinner. It is also the most demanded one for family get-togethers and occasions.

The entanglement of the pungent pickle, the creamy raita, and the spicy channay is a gastronomic treat.
