                <h2>about this item: </h2>
                <p> BBQ Tikka, a traditional Pakistani-style dish, is all about the uniqueness of these flavors: tender meat, marinated in the most original of the spicy blends, grilled until absolutely ready. Our Momcuisine's authentic BBQ Tikka stands apart from the crowd, becoming a favorite thanks to its well-spiced and juicy texture of the dish.


                    Firstly let me make it clear that the meat does not compromise on quality. It could be chicken, beef or lamb as long as it is cut into small bites for a quick barbecue. Following the meat portion, we marinate it in a yogurt mix with ginger, garlic, lemon, and traditional spices, including cumin, coriander, paprika, and garam masala. This marinade not only subtlety flavors the meat but also it smooths down the tough fibers, so the tenderness you experience will be incredibly satisfying.
                    
                    
                    Once marinated, the meat is usually set on skewers, slow grilled over and open fire with a smokey, charred outer edge keeping the inside juicy and tender. The smokiness that comes from grilling enriches the natural smokiness of the meat which in turn unifies the plethora of spices in the marinade.
                    
                    
                    BBQ Tikka which is known to be a joint of chicken is always partnered with naan raita or roti for person who requires slight contrast with the hotness level of the dish. It is like meat you can eat either as a main dish or a side dish with other grilled over meat and vegetables.
                    
                    
                    Through our skill and care, we are not only capturing the real taste of Pakistani BBQ Tikka, but we are also giving a glimpse in to the age old traditional grilling techniques practiced in our land. Beside from bringing together family, friends and especially at happy moments BBQ Tikka is always a top choice when it comes to the choice of the food. Presenting them with outstanding meat flavors combined with robust spices and smoke unrivalled by other cuisines makes our restaurant a much-loved spot.
