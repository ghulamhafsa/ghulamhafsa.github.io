                <h2>about this item: </h2>
                <p> Halwa Puri -- a cherished Pakistani breakfast recipe -- juxtaposes sweetness and spice to create a meal that floods all, your senses. Mama's Kitchen does not only give you the taste of this dish but we also make sure that the actual feel and flavor of this Pakistani food are not compromised.


                    The dish has two key components: halva, a very rich and sweet semolina dessert, and puri, a light and puff fried bread. Our halva is made from fine wheat semolina, clarified butter, sugar and cardamom, so that the final product is a silky dessert with a nice light brown color. Sometimes we choose to add nuts and raisins for their texture and taste. With that each bite becomes a wonderful moment for eating.
                    
                    
                    Puri is a fried bread that rises up dramatically, with crispy exterior and airy inside. Light and golden, our puris will make a great vessel for halwa scooping, as well as partner with the dishes like chana masala (spiced chickpeas) and aloo bhaji (potato curry). The duality of the crispy puri and soft halwa hypes up goes way beyond the point of satisfaction each time.
                    
                    
                    When it comes to healthy and tasty meals, we serve you Halwa Puri as a complete meal with chana masala and aloo bhaji as traditional sides at Mama's Kitchen. The Chana Masala is a tongue tickling spicy dish with the Alu Bhaji being a warm and juicy potato curry that makes a wonderful combo.
                    
                    
                    Haul Puri is beyond meal; it is the uniting factor over the sense of taste and lovely association of people. It's one of the most popular places for weekend brunches, family dinners, and celebrations, especially during holidays. At Mama's Kitchen, we're really lucky to offer you Halwa Puri that's made in a passionate way and served with a smile. Swing by us and have a taste of this famous Pakistani breakfast. It will make your heart warm and soul happy!!
