                <h2>about this item: </h2>
                <p> The fresh Kachoomar Salad is a lively and healthy dish identifying with the South Asian cuisine. It is crunchy, and has a bright and fresh taste, which makes it the perfect side dish to most of your meals. At Mama's Kitchen, We make Fresh Kachoomar Salads with ingredients par excellence to guarantee that it is as refreshing as it is delicious.


                    The secret of a perfect kachoomar salad lies hidden in the blend of fresh vegetables. The recipe begins with tomatoes peeled off, cucumbers sliced, and red onions diced to form a variety of colors. The salad also features the green chillies that just bring a mild heat without overpowering the other flavors.
                    
                    
                    The coriander leaves with extracted juice of the lemon or lime gives the salad its special zing. The citrusy taste of the dressing harps your taste buds with a deep fresh note, which complements the natural sweetness of the tomatoes and the cucumbers. A touch of salt and pepper and that is it, the flavors of the vegetables come out harmoniously and you have a humble salad ready.
                    
                    
                    The salad is able to be served with different foods including grilled meats as well as rice based dishes like biryani. It does a wonderful job in contrast to more complex dishes,meaning it is suitable for mid day as well as evening meals.
