                <h2>about this item: </h2>
                <p> Special Pizza stands for more than just a pizza; it represents a riot of taste and imagination. The Special Pizza at Mama's Kitchen is a creation of premium toppings, a rich, tomato sauce, and generous cheese amounts will leave you satisfied and full.


                    The basic of our Special Pizza begins with a hand-tossed dough rolled out to the best thickness for a crust that is wholesome, crispy and chewy. Next, our fresh tomato sauce based on the ripe tomatoes, garlic, and Italian herbs will be added, creating the basic taste for the pizza.
                    
                    
                    Our Pizza Special has toppings made from various ingredients. We do a combination of spiced meats such as pepperoni, sausage, and bacon to bring out the rich and savory textures. To complement the meat, we provide a variety of fresh vegetables such as bell peppers, onions and mushrooms which give a wonderful fruity twist and a sweet finish.
                    
                    
                    To start with, no pizza looks like the pizza without cheese. We opt for a combination of mozzarella and other cheeses that melt perfectly to produce a golden and gooey top layer. The cheese integrates all the ingredients creating every bite tasteful and juicy.
                    
                    
                    The Special Pizza is a great option for sharing with your relatives and friends during lunch or dinner as well as the party or any other special event. It's filling and satisfying and its many toppings will make anyone a happy person.
