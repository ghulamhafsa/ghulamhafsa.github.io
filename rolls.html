                <h2>about this item: </h2>
                <p> The Cheesy Rolls are a lovely delicacy where a soft and fluffy bread is stuffed with cheese that melt as you eat it. At Mama's Kitchen, our Cheesy Rolls are handcrafted with attention to detail to provide a perfect combination of textures and flavors that would leave you with a warm, gooey, and amazing treat.


                    First of all, we prepare a delicate dough which is later rolled out and generously stuffed with a large amount of cheese. We have mozzarella, cheddar and Parmesan cheeses in our case which form a combination of creamy and sharp flavors. The rolls are then pushed down to squeeze the cheese in and create a tightly coiled spiral. This forms a beautiful roll of cheesy goodness.
                    
                    
                    The outer layer of the Cheesy Rolls is baked to a perfect shade of golden brown, making it firm but not very crispy, inside everything is soft and fluffy. Throughout the baking process, the cheese melts and leaks into the bread, which results in an absolutely delicious, melty, gooey center that is practically irresistible. The fragrance of freshly prepared rolls with melted cheese already stimulates the appetite.
                    
                    
                    To bring in more flavor, we usually brush some garlic butter on the outside of the rolls before baking. That way we get the beautiful blend of tastes and scentful aroma. These additions add a little bit of boldness to the rolls, which is especially enjoyable when combined with the cheese.
                    
                    
                    Cheesy Rolls will spice up the most boring menu. They can be served as an appetizer, or as a side dish, perfect for dipping into sauces, or any broth-based soups. Furthermore, they can be served as a snack, among friends and family during more casual occasions.
