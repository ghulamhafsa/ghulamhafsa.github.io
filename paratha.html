                <h2>about this item: </h2>
                <p> This delicacy (aloo ka paratha) originates from the great Punjabi cuisine (the heart) all over the world & now has become a paratha crust you cannot miss in this life. At Mama's Kitchen, it is the classic paratha spiced up with the taste and aroma of a traditional Punjabi kitchen, an ambudge that will transport you back to those days of having food prepared right in our houses.


                    Our homemade aloo ka paratha richer in taste is started with a soft whole wheat dough rolled out and filled with a savory mixture of potatoes spiced made with blend of different vegetables, peas, cauliflower and paneer. The filling takes up a concerted mix of potato, onion (chopped), green chilies, fresh coriander and aromatic spices of cumin and garam masala to give this filling a harmony in flavors and, gradually, a richer and delicious taste.
                    
                    
                    After tuning in them, the dough is gently covered and rolled into a thin disc On a hot and sizzling griddle trimmed with ample amounts of butter or ghee, the flatbread partha is taken to be cooked. Both the interior and the exterior are golden brown and soft textured. By walking into a restaurant, it's not the sidedishes and buttered potatoes that give me butterflies, but by the smell alone, IT'S ENOUGH TO SEND MY MOUTH WATERING.
                    
                    
                    Aloo paratha can be savored at any time of the day, it can be made for breakfast, lunch,and dinner. Conventionally, it is relished after mixing spoonful of yoghurt or sharp pickle, which will enhance the richness of parathas or refrsigate the taste. It is also ideal to have it for dunking into your favorite curry or gravy with which you can take all the taste of those yummy sauces.
