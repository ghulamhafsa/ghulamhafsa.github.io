                <h2>about this item: </h2>
                <p> Naan Haleem is a pity when taking about Pakistani cuisine which is the blend of the irresistible, toothy texture of haleem with the enjoyable taste of naan. At Mama's Kitchen, the meal will not be complete without this traditional favorite of ours and, thus, we have re-created this meal to its traditional status with our unique touch so as to satiate your soul as well as your appetite.


                    Haleem's protein-rich consistency is due to the fact it is carefully and slowly stewed with a combination of crushed wheat, barley, lentils, and either beef or chicken. The mixture is stewed for hours until the flavors melted and formed into thick creamy beat which is just as yummy. Aromatic spices such as cumin, coriander, turmeric, and garam masala add finesse within the dishes, while ginger and garlic provide a delicious warm underlying tone.
                    
                    
                    We combine this timeless dish with warm-out-of-oven naan baked to a crisp sensation and a great harmony of flavor. The chewy and crispy bread on the side is the perfect weapon against the creamy, liquid like haleem. Either you go for the untoasted kind that you can spread with butter on it or the sesame version going well with the hearty dish that you ordered.
                    
                    
                    With Naan Haleem at Mama Kitchen, the journey of gorging on a delicacy goes beyond simply having a meal but an emotional roller coaster of sheer comfort. Being cozy and comfortable, this restaurant is an ideal setting for family dinners, fun lunches with friends or significant social events. We serve it with either fried onions, fresh coriander or even chili that you have to lick with the flavor of the lemon juice, to your preference.
                    
                    
                    Indeed, we conduct Naan Haleem just as they would be prepared in traditional family kitchens whereas at Mama's we take great pride. Click on us to taste a true and aromatic envoy of childhood in a "chill place" and find yourself at home between food and people.
